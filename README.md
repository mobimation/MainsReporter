# MainsReporter
Android app that sends SMS to stakeholders upon change in charger status (Power on/off)
of the phone where the app runs.
Used for reporting of a change in mains voltage at the location where and old scrap Android phone resides
with its charger plugged into the mains outlet.  It was developed for use in a indie developer office
where the power could go off some time per week when someone in the building burnt a main fuse. By getting an SMS from the charging phone that the power is out I could avoid wasting time going there while other people sorted out the power issue.
